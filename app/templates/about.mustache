<h1>About Novel Observer</h1>

<p class="lead">In my dissertation, I made a claim that needed evidence. Namely, I asserted
  that John Dos Passos’s work <em>U.S.A.</em> was especially full of
  geographical data—placenames, to be precise. This feels true when one reads the
  work, but why not try to prove it?</p>

<p>My solution was to pull down from my shelf a handful of U.S. novels written
  around the same time period and do a simple random<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  sample for each novel. I
  picked 20 pages (I think) at random and counted up how many placenames were
  on each page. Next the computer found the sample mean and the standard
  deviation. Since I was dealing with a small sample, I used the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-distribution"><var>t</var>-distribution</a>
  to calculate for 95% <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence</a>.</p>

<p>What this app does is let anyone do the same thing to count whatever it is
  that is interesting to the person, be it placenames, allusions, pronouns,
  whatever. The process is not automated, because the idea is that by sampling,
  the amount of data entry is not terribly high, and the results are just about
  OK.</p>

<p>I know that, personally, as I add to this database, I will be finding more
  and more “geographically rich” novels that I could subsequently teach or talk
  about in some way. Furthermore, I'll be finding what amount of toponymic data
  is “normal.”</p>

<p>Finally, by graphing the uncertainty (if however awkwardly for the time
  being), I hope to emphasize Johanna Drucker’s point that humanists deal not
  with <em>data</em>, but, rather, with <em>capta</em>. These counts are
  initial attempts to make use of “graphical strategies [that] express
  interpreted knowledge, situated and partial, rather than complete.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
